ðŸ§  Customer Churn Classification Project
ðŸ“Œ Objective
This project aims to predict customer churn based on demographic and behavioral attributes using a Logistic Regression model. Churn is defined as customers likely to leave based on their income and purchase frequency.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
A synthetic dataset was generated with the following features:

Age: Customer's age
Gender: 0 = Female, 1 = Male
Income: Annual income (in thousands)
PurchaseFrequency: Number of purchases per month
Churn: 1 = Likely to churn, 0 = Not likely to churn
Customers with Income < $40k and Purchase Frequency < 3 are labeled as likely to churn.
